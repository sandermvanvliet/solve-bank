# Checking account assignment

## Assignment
You (a senior software developer) and a friend (a business man) are going to disrupt the financial world with a new type of Bank. Your friends' research showed that people are mostly annoyed by the fees that they have to pay for their banking services. Your bank is going to offer a free checking account for its customers. What the businessplan exactly is, is beyond your knowledge but you and your friend are going to be rich by the end of the year.

 

To get rich, your friend has set a couple of goals for you:

- You have to write software to let people put money in the bank, transfer money to another account of the bank, and take money out again.

- You cannot afford to lose money from customers!

- You must have some kind of report that shows your friend your software is working as expected.

- You have 2 launching customers, however the launch date is [Wednesday 25th July, 9:00am]

- Again, you cannot afford to lose money from customers!

- The bank will be operated by a nice woman named Diana who takes requests from customers over the phone and will use your software to operate the bank.

 

Hints:

- Please allow not more than about 4 hours for your assignment.

- You may choose the stack you're comfortable with.

- Concentrate on the banks' end, you do not have to write client software for customers. A simple interface (for Diana) should suffice.

## Questions
1) Can I assume Diana is infallible in identifying customers? In other words: will the application have to verify the identity of the customer or will Diana do that?
2) Do I need to worry about multiple currencies? Or are Euros fine?
3) Can customers withdraw more money than is on their balance? In other words: does the software need support overdraft? If so, by how much? (And does this need to be configurable?) If customers are overdrawn is there an interest that needs to be applied?
4) Although I don't have any idea about the business plans and all, is there an interest rate that applies on the checking account?
